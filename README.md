### Welcome to VerifBFL: Leveraging zk-SNARKs for A Verifiable Blockchained Federated Learning.

### Repository Structure

- `aggproof/`: This directory contains the implementation of the aggregation proof within our framework.
- `bcfl-hh/`: Contains smart-contracts code implementing the business logic of our framework.
- `trainingproof/`:  similar to `aggproof`, holds the implementation of the accuracy proof.
- `verification-ea/`: is a Rust implementation of the external adapter which hosts the api endpoint for proof verification.

### How to Use This Repository

If you wish to reproduce the experiments or explore the code, please refer to the detailed documentation provided in each directory. The `README.md` files in individual folders will guide you through the setup and usage of the respective components.
